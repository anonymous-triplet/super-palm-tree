"""Smart car parks for the SUMO bridge.

Cars choose a lot, drive to the kerb in front of its barrier and stop (a SUMO parking stop). The lot looks at its own occupancy:

* room and barrier not closed: the barrier opens, the car is handed to Godot (removed from SUMO) and drives in, parks in a
  bay, stays for a while, then drives out and is put back into SUMO at the same kerb spot with a route out of the city;
* lot full (or barrier closed): the barrier stays shut and the warning triangle shows; after a short hold the car carries on
  and is sent to the nearest other lot that still has room, or back into normal traffic when none has.

SUMO owns every moving car; this module owns the cars inside the lots. Godot only presents them: it receives, in each state
packet, every lot's occupancy and the phase and start time of each car (kerb queue / entering / alighting / parked /
boarding / leaving) and animates them from those times, so the picture always agrees with the counts. Everything here
runs in simulation time.
