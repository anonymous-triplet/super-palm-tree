## Geometry of an incident scene in Godot space, derived from the live poses
## of the scene's stationary vehicles (wrecks and units on scene). It is the
## single source for where responders may stand and walk:
##
## * kerb band (3.9–5.75 m from the centreline): no vehicle body in the lane
##   ever reaches it (widest truck spans 0.85–3.65 m);
## * door-access strips (0.45–3.9 m) only alongside stationary scene vehicles
##   (1.3 m past each end, inside the minimum gap of the next car)
##   and across gaps between them shorter than an overtaking car needs to
##   merge back (9.5 m), so nothing can drive there;
## * for junction scenes: a 1.3 m zone around each wreck (green paths keep
##   3.2 m from the wreck), and the junction box only while signals are held
##   for crews to cross.
