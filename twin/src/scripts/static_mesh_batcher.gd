extends Node
## Static batching for simple scenery that never moves or changes material.
##
## Thousands of individual building, tree and road meshes cost one draw call
## each (and one more per shadow cascade). After the city has finished
## placing its scenery, every static surface under the target containers is
## merged per (map chunk, material) into a single mesh, and each original
## MeshInstance3D is hidden on the rendering server only: it is drawn by no
## camera and no light, yet the node keeps its groups, transform, bounds and
## visible flag for every system that queries the scene (cameras, spatial
## safety, obstacle indexes, selection). When a batched original is later
## hidden or shown (stations clearing ambient props, spatial safety), only the
## batch that holds it is rebuilt from the originals that are still visible.

## Scenery containers (paths relative to the City root) that are batched.
