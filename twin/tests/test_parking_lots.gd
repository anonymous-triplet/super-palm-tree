## The smart car parks as the city shows them: every sited lot exists, the board reads "occupied/capacity", a full or closed lot
## says so, the barrier arm lifts while a car passes, the red warning triangle shows while a car is turned away, and the device
## interface reports every lot. The bridge side is tested against real SUMO in scripts/test_parking_lots.py.
